**Abstract:** Geographic isolation is among the most important factors initiating speciation in mammals. The narrow-headed vole Lasiopodomys gregalis Pallas, 1779 is a widely distributed species in steppe habitats of South Siberia that are highly fragmented by mountain ranges. Previously, three major mostly allopatric mitochondrial lineages of L. gregalis were described within the distribution range, and all of them occur in South Siberia. Here we apply the analysis of five microsatellite loci and species distribution modeling to describe the genetic structure of L. gregalis populations in South Siberia. Microsatellite analysis revealed three clusters corresponding to mitochondrial lineages and indicated that gene flow between them is strongly limited. Distribution of suitable habitats predicted that lineages are geographically well separated from each other with only a small number of possible contact zones. Traces of hybridization were found in the only population at the border of B and C lineages. Our data show the ongoing process of cryptic speciation in three L. gregalis lineages that most plausibly splitted in the Middle Pleistocene.
